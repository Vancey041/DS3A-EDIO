      Sasuke Uchiha is a prodigy of the Uchiha Clan and Naruto’s rival. His life is shaped by tragedy 
      when his older brother, Itachi, annihilates their clan. Consumed by vengeance, Sasuke dedicates 
      himself to growing stronger, often isolating himself from those who care for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though his path leads him into darkness and away from his comrades, his deep connection to Naruto 
      and Team 7 never truly fades. Sasuke embodies the struggle between revenge and redemption, making 
      his journey one of the most complex and emotional in the shinobi world.
