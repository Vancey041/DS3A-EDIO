    <p>
      Kakashi Hatake, known as the "Copy Ninja," is the calm and enigmatic leader of Team 7. Despite 
      his laid-back demeanor, he is one of the most skilled shinobi of his generation, mastering a 
      thousand jutsu with his Sharingan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His past is marked by tragedy — losing his father, teammates, and sensei. These experiences shape 
      his philosophy that teamwork is more important than individual talent. Beneath his mask and 
      aloofness lies a man deeply loyal to his comrades, guiding Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura with 
      patience and wisdom.
