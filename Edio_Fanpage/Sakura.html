      Sakura Haruno begins her journey as a bright but self-conscious kunoichi who admires Sasuke and 
      often clashes with Naruto. Initially seen as the weakest in Team 7, she eventually undergoes 
      incredible growth under the tutelage of Tsunade, the Fifth Hokage.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her exceptional chakra control, superhuman strength, and medical ninjutsu, Sakura becomes a 
      vital asset to her team and the shinobi world. Beyond her abilities, she demonstrates compassion, 
      determination, and resilience, proving that she is far more than just a supporting figure.
